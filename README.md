### Hi there 👋

I like to work on OpenSource Tools and Cool stuff on the Cloud! If you are like me? You'll find my updates on OpenSource tools quite useful!

Check out below 👇

    * [AWS Notebook](https://histre.com/public/notebooks/dnllyanu/aws/) is the collection of tools I have used or browsed in my daily search 🕵️ could be useful if you work on AWS ☁️
    * [Kubernetes Notebook](https://histre.com/public/notebooks/6uxdvo3y/kubernetes/) talks more of kubernetes, quite be overwhelming! 😅
    * Follow [#devopskhan](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/devopskhan/) on LinkedIn for more frequent content on OpenSource tools! ✨
    * Occasionally shares on [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/@ej6g8d1dp2829A16a9Tf5d4T6bAMp3d8791rejDe86yem3bm4e14ex4fT4dluk29)!
